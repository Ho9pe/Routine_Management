# University Routine Manager

## Project Overview
A web application for managing university class routines with separate panels for students and teachers. Teachers can input their preferences and schedules, while students can view their class routines. The system automatically generates routines based on academic rank priorities.

## System Architecture
- **Frontend:** React.js/Next.js - Vanilla JS, CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js - Vanilla JS
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:** JWT/OAuth

## Database Schema

- student_roll (PK)
- username
- password (hashed)
- email
- department
- created_at

### Teachers
- teacher_id (PK)
- full_name
- academic_rank
- department
- contact_info

### Courses
- course_id (PK)
- course_code
- course_name
